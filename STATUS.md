# Badge(s) Description
We want to apply for reusable badges and available badges. 
- All data can be publicly accessed via Github.
- The data is well documented, which supports the developers to able the artifact easily in their future study. In the data, we provide the website links of DNN bugs to support the developers in their future studies. 
- We provide an INSTALL file to show how to reproduce data.
- The data can be easily extended by several methods. For instance, we can extend the artifact by mining more Stack Overflow questions or Github commits. It also can be extended by using other open-source websites or Q&A websites.
