# Repairing Deep Neural Networks Fix Patterns and Challenges
The artifact contains the labeled bug fix patterns of deep learning bugs. From Stack Overflow and Gihub, we have studied 415 bug repairs and 555 bug repairs, respectively. To understand the challenge in fixing deep learning bugs of developers, we have focused our study on five deep learning libraries which are Caffe, Keras, Tensorflow, Theano, and Torch. After the study, we have realized the different between bug fix pattern of traditional software and deep learning software. Moreover, we also find out some frequent bug repairs of deep learning program such as modifying network connectivity or repairing the mismatch data demension.
