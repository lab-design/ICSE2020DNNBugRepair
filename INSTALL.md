All of the data is created manually and stored as a form of excel file. 
- THe files Stack Overflow and Github stores all the bugs and bug fix patterns collected from Stack Overflow and Github of five libraries, respectively. Each excel file has five columns, which are bug, the bug fix pattern from a prior study, and new bug fix pattern. The first column, bug, stores all the website links of Stack Overflow questions and Github commits, which contains deep learning bugs. The second column, bug fix pattern from a prior study, is the labels of bug fix pattern of the deep learning bug based on the prior study. However, these labels are applied to traditional programs, which is not suitable for Deep learning programs. Thus, we have created new appropriate labels for deep learning software. The third column, bug fix pattern, is the new bug fix pattern label of each collected DNN bug. The fourth column, library, shows which library the bug belong. The final column, bug type, represent the types of deep learning bugs which are created from prior study. 

- The files Fig1a and Fig1b show the bug fix pattern distribution of Stack Overflow and Github of all five deep learning libraries, respectively. Each file contain a table with two column. The first column presents the types of bug fix patterns. The second column shows the distribution of the bug fix pattern in all the libraries.

- The file Table3 indicates the percentage of each bug fix pattern of each deep learning library. GH and SO columns are the percentage of bug fix patterns of Github and Stack Overflow, respectively. 

- The files Fig2 and Fig3 show the distribution of bug fix patterns for different bug types of Stack Overflow and Github, respectively. 
 
- THe file Fig6+Table5 show the distribution of the new bugs across the different libraries and how these new bugs are classified into different categories of bug type, root cause, and impact.  

- The Table6 file presents the changes of Tensorflow APIs in diferrent versions. The first column shows the name of Tensorflow APIs in the lastest version, version 2. The remaining column shows the name of these APIs in the previous versions which includes 1.14, 1.13, 1.12, 1.11, 1.1.
