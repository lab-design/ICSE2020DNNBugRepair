The data is created manually and stored in the form of Excel file.
- The Excel files Stack Overflow and Github store the deep learning bugs collected from Stack Overflow and Github of five libraries, respectively. Each file has five columns, which are bug, the bug fix pattern from a prior study, bug fix pattern, library, and bug type. The first column, bug, stores the Stack Overflow posts and Github commits, which contains deep learning bugs. The second column, bug fix pattern from a prior study, is the labels of bug fix pattern of the deep learning bug based on the prior study. However, these labels are applied to traditional programs, which are not suitable for Deep learning programs. Thus, we have created new appropriate labels for deep learning software. The third column, bug fix pattern, is the new bug fix pattern labels for DNN bugs. The fourth column, library, shows which library the bug belongs. The final column, bug type, represents the types of deep learning bugs which are created from a prior study.

- The Excel files Fig1a and Fig1b show the bug fix pattern distribution of Stack Overflow and Github of five deep learning libraries, respectively. Each file contains a table with two columns. The first column presents the types of bug fix patterns. The second column shows the distribution of the bug fix pattern in five libraries.

- The Excel file Table3 indicates the percentage of each bug fix pattern of each deep learning library. SO and GH columns are the percentage of bug fix patterns of Stack Overflow and Github, respectively.

- The Excel files Fig2 and Fig3 show the distribution of bug fix patterns for different bug types of Stack Overflow and Github, respectively.

- The Excel file Fig6+Table5 shows the distribution of the new bugs across the different libraries and how these new bugs are classified into different categories of bug type, root cause, and impact.

- The Excel file Table6 presents the changes of Tensorflow APIs in different versions. The first column shows the name of Tensorflow APIs in the lastest version, version 2. The remaining columns show the names of these APIs in the previous versions which includes 1.14, 1.13, 1.12, 1.11, 1.1.
