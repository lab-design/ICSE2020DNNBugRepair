All of the data is created manually and stored as a form of excel file. 
- Stack Overflow file and Github file stores all the bugs and bug fix patterns collected from Stack Overflow and Github of five libraries, respectively. Each excel file has five columns, which are bug, the bug fix pattern from a prior study, and new bug fix pattern. The first column, bug, stores all the website links of Stack Overflow questions and Github commits, which contains deep learning bugs. The second column, bug fix pattern from a prior study, is the labels of bug fix pattern of the deep learning bug based on the prior study. However, these labels are applied to traditional programs, which is not suitable for Deep learning programs. Thus, we have created new appropriate labels for deep learning software. The third column, bug fix pattern, is the new bug fix pattern label of each collected DNN bug. The fourth column, library, shows which library the bug belong. The final column, bug type, represent the types of deep learning bugs which are created from prior study. 


 
The data is stored in multiple excel files for multiple information. Each part is an excel file. 

- 
- Caffe file stores the bug and bug fix patterns collected from Stack Overflow and Github commits of Caffe. 
- Keras file stores the bug and bug fix patterns collected from Stack Overflow and Github commits of Keras. 
- Tensorflow file stores the bug and bug fix patterns collected from Stack Overflow and Github commits of Tensorflow.  
- Theano file stores the bug and bug fix patterns collected from Stack Overflow and Github commits of Theano.  
- Torch file stores the bug and bug fix patterns collected from Stack Overflow and Github commits of Torch.
